# PyQuiz-App

# Overview

This Project's purpose was to allow us to learn both Java and how to create a mobile app. We wanted to create something fun that we could continue to make great.

This program displays questions from a JSON file. The user file be given 10 seconds to answer 5 consecutive questions. Then they will be given a final score reflecting how they did.

In future renditions we plan to make it more beginner friendly. We want to help beginner programmers have fun and learn more about python.
